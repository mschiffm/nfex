.SH NAME
nfex \- Network File EXtractor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nfex
[\-fdcohv]
.if n .ti +5n
.SH DESCRIPTION
nfex is tool for extracing files from TCP streams. It is based off of 
(the defunct) tcpxtract by Nicholas Harbour. It pulls files from the network
(untested) or from pcap dump files (tested). It offers a tunable configuration
file that instructs the search and extraction code what sort of files to flag
and extract. It also offers a few enhancements over tcpxtract including several
bugfixes and an asynchronous interface to the user to allow for real-time
status and progress queries. The tool is still very much in development and 
any patches or add-ons are welcomed.
